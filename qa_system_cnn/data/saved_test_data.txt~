Question 1:
What Is The Average Car Insurance Rate In Utah ?
Positive Answer:
Auto insurance is priced based on several variables including : The type of car covered The age , gender , and marital status of the insured The coverage amounts elected by the insured For this reasons it 's difficult to say exactly what you 'd pay for coverage in any specific state However it is potentially noteworthy that Utah ranks number 12 within the nation for cheapest states in which to purchase auto insurance . This statistic comes from Bankrate .
Negative Answers:
1 I recommend at least enough to pay final expenses and possible medical bills . Keep in mind , the loss of a child is an extremely emotional and stressful time . The last thing a grieving parent needs is to try to figure out where to come up with the money to pay for burial and medical bills . Life insurance on a child is not expensive . My personal opinion is a base of $ 25000 . If the child does n't die , it puts the child in a good inexpensive plan until he can afford additional insurance when he is older .
2 Life insurance tests blood so that they can more accurately assess the rate you will be charged , or if you are able to qualify for the life insurance policy at all . Blood tests can tip them off to diseases that the applicant may not be aware they have , such as type 2 diabetes or liver disease . Blood tests also uncover nicotine or drug use that is not admitted on the application . By testing blood , the insurance company helps assure their own solvency , and in turn , protects all who hold policies with them .

Question 2:
Can I Get Life Insurance With A Criminal Record ?
Positive Answer:
On every life insurance application , there are questions about your criminal history . Felony convictions may cause a denial of your request for coverage . Insurance companies may attribute lifestyle choices and behavior to a certain level of risk . Some companies will accept certain misdemeanors , but your premiums may be a bit more expensive because of it .
Negative Answers:
1 Not in most states . The bank will require it in most cases however to protect themselves if you carry a mortgage on the property . If you do not have a mortgage and want to assume the risk , not only of fixing or replacing your home in the event of a loss but also the risk of law suit , then you do not have to carry homeowners insurance . Think hard about it , is it really worth the risk ?
2 That 's an easy one . You are alive and presumably have either family , friends , someone you love or care very much about , belong to a religion or religious group or charity or other public cause .

Thank you . GARY LANE .
3 Obama Care is working well in California . Go to www.coveredca.com to get started on a quote .

People who earn less than $ 48,000 per year may be eligible for premium assistance . In this video WEBSITELINK I show you an example of a 30 year old who earns $ 25,000 per year who can get the Bronze level plan for $ 18 per month .
4 Retirement planning is an evolving science . There isnt consensus on the best way to prepare for retirement ; however , moving money from your current account to the future account is the basic step you must take . Relying upon the return on investments is at best grasping at a straw as those who lived through 2008 know . Move capital , start now , dont quit and review your plan , review your plan , review your plan .
Question 3:
Can A Health Insurance Company Deny Me Coverage ?
Positive Answer:
Under the affordable care act , a health insurance company can not deny you coverage for any pre-existing medical condition or other related illness . Please note , you can only apply for a health insurance plan during the annual enrollment period unless you have a qualifying event -LRB- e.g. getting married , having a baby , coming off of group coverage , etc. -RRB- for a special enrollment period . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
Negative Answers:
1 Yes , you can get quotes online by going to a Life Insurance Company 's website . It 's a very quick process . If you are interested in a particular quote you will have to talk to their agent and sign an application . The downside of going to a particular company 's website is that the insurance company can only give you one company 's quotes . If you talk to a broker , he/she can take your information once and provide quotes from tens of companies .
2 Lightning is a covered peril of renters insurance so if lightning for example causes a fire that destroys your personal items you would be covered . If you are referring to a electrical surge to something like your TV or computer there would be a limitation of coverage 's depending on the carrier .

Question 4:
Is Medicare Deducted From Pension Payments ?
Positive Answer:
Medicare Part B is typically deducted from your social security check . Your Medicare Supplement premium is typically set up as an automatic payment between the insurance carrier and your checking account . You may still be able to mail in your payment but most carriers would prefer you to set up the automatic payment . There is an advantage for you in doing this . Medicare Supplement Plans are `` guaranteed renewable '' which means the only way the insurance carrier can cancel your plan is for non payment .

1 How to apply for Disability Insurance : Contact a life insurance broker that sells different types of Disability insurance policies to find your best quote . Select your policy and fill out the application . Take the free paramed exam . Get approved . Pay for the policy and return delivery requirements .
2 In most cases , if you can pass the no medical exam medical and background check , you can pass the medical exam - and thereby save hundreds of dollars each year . And know that if the insurer finds that you lied on the no medical questionnaire -LRB- and they will check -RRB- , then they have no obligation to pay a claim on your life , even if you paid into your policy for years . However , there is a fantastic new plan availablewhereyou can get up to $ 100,000 of life coverage with no medical exam and no questions . The only qualification is thatyou are working at least 20 hours per week . That 's it!Contact QualityTermLife for more information .
3 For a single premium a life insurance company will give your beneficiary thousands of times as much money . That seems to me to be a good investment . The discussion of the value of insurance as an investment comes from the fact that cash value life insurance has deferred taxation . That feature can be beneficial but under few circumstances will the total investment in a whole life policy equal the face amount or death benefit . It is quite frequent that your beneficiary will receive much more than the sum of your deposits .
4 Banner life insurance is a great company and they are part of the Legal & General of America companies . Banner started in 1949 as Government Employees Life Insurance Company -LRB- GELICO -RRB- .

Question 5:
What Is A Contingent For Life Insurance ?
Positive Answer:
What is a contingent for life insurance ? Contingent is a term applied to the seconary beneficiary . The contingent beneficiary comes into play on a life policy when the primary beneficiary has also passed prior to the death of the insured or decides to turn down the benefit offered to them .
Negative Answers:
1 Yes , you can purchase term life insurance if you have good health . There are a few carriers that offer term life at fairly reasonable prices . I personally just delivered a term life insurance policy on a healthy 74 year old that needed better rates than a whole life policy would have cost .
2 Great question ! There would be a couple of immediate results . The first is that you would no longer have the benefit of insurance to help pay for costs should you become sick or injured . Those costs can be devastating to your financial stability . The second is that under the Affordable Care Act , there are penalties for not having insurance , that are leveled when you file your taxes for this year . The health insurance companies limit the ability to enroll in their programs , and many workplace plans will not drop you until the open enrollment period unless you meet specified conditions.Without knowing the reason that you are considering dropping your coverage , I would ask that you would have a plan in place before you actually do drop your coverage . If I can provide more information , please feel free to contact me . Thanks for asking !
3 If you have a Term policy the cash value is Zero . Nadda . Zilch . If you have a Universal policy or a WHole Life policy it will depend on how long you 've had the policy , how much you 've paid into it , and if your insurance provider pays dividends to you - how well the companies investments have performed . As Peggy mentioned you can ask your agent for the current cash value of your policy , or you can request an `` In Force Illustration '' from the insurance company . But you SHOULD be receiving an annual report that should tell you what the current cash value is and the current face value benefit is .
4 Cataract surgery is generally performed under Part B . It will cover 80 % of the approved amount . If the doctor accepts Medicare then he will be required to accept whatever Medicare approves . You are only responsible for 20 % . Some states allow 15 % excess charges over what Medicare approves . The exact amount Medicare approves would depend on the way the charge is billed . Ask your doctor what Medicare usually pays . This may help give you an idea of your responsibility .
Question 6:
Can Employers Charge Smokers More For Health Insurance ?
Positive Answer:
Yes . Application of a premium surcharge for tobacco users has become more common in recent years , primarily in larger groups who self-fund their employee benefits plans as the employer has much more control of the benefit plan design and rate structure than they do with fully insured plans . The Affordable Care Act -LRB- ACA -RRB- , while doing away with pre-existing condition exclusions , does explicitly allow for the adjustment of rates for tobacco use . So , in that sense , tobacco users are the class of employees it is legal to discriminate or penalize for their personal behavior . The ACA is silent on the consumption of Marijuana which may present some interesting situations as more states move to allow the use of medical Marijuana or to legalize its recreational use .
Negative Answers:
1 It is a contract with a charity in which the charity will agree to pay a certain amount of money , normally monthly , to one or even two people , during their life . This will be done in return for cash or property given to the charity . These plans permit a person to pass assets to a charity while insuring them of a stream of income . The stream of income is guaranteed by the full assets of the charity .
2 You can but your not supposed to . Having two polices will not addcoverageor multiplycoverage 's All having two polices will do is create a claimnightmareas both companies would have to step in a split the cost or decide who is going to pay . Either way two polices create problems and it 's not worth it .
3 If you are currently receiving treatment for lung cancer , unfortunately you are unable to get a life insurance policy unless it is guaranteed issue . Guaranteed issue policies do not ask any health questions and usually have a minimum age of 40 to 55 . They also will have a graded period the first years of the policy , and have a fairly low maximum face amount -LRB- under $ 50,000 -RRB- . Then when you have been cancer free for a while your options will improve .
4 Life insurance is an umbrella term that encompasses the two main types of life insurance : Term Life Insurance and Permanent Life Insurance . Both pay out a death benefit to a beneficiary if the insured person dies . Term Life is limited to that function , and is only in force for a set period , or `` term '' of time . Permanent life insurance has more bells and whistles , and is in for for a lifetime , or `` permanently '' .
Question 7:
Who Is The Best Life Insurance Provider ?
Positive Answer:
There are hundreds of life insurance companies in America . There are six ratings services that perform economic due diligence and assign a numerical or alphabet category of either financial strength or claims paying ability . The rating levels between rating services are often not equivalent . Its important to secure as many rating services to assist the company selection process . Here are just a few of the rating services that are available that we use to determine financial strength and claims paying ability : S&P , Moodys , AM Best , Fitch , Comdex and Weise . Each life insurance company is required to file their financial statement called the convention blank or blue book . A summary of that financial filing is produced by surveillance services that we monitor . The ideal life insurance company is one with high ratings , strong balance sheet , competitive pricing and consumer centric contractual provisions . We routinely examine these carriers for consumers to assist them in a quality decision on selecting the right company for them .
Negative Answers:
1 Like other forms of insurance , the basis of the health insurance companies is the need to share a risk that is too great for an individual . Companies are formed to provide the framework for administering these groups . Ultimately the company handles administrative work because the vast majority of the funds received are used to pay the medical expenses of the participants in the plan .
2 You can lower your car insurance rates by doing the following : Consider raising your collision and comprehensive deductibles . Check to make sure you are receiving all of theavailablediscounts including multi-policy , 55 and retired and alarm system . SHOP SHOP SHOP !!! When you shop different companies , you may be able to reduce your premium . A respected website will offer multiple quotes from top-rated companies . You may save more than you thought was possible .
3 Annuity companies are required to invest the majority of their portfolios in bonds . They do have flexibility to invest in bonds that are rated high or low . If a high-grade bond is AAA rated , it will provide a lower return to the annuity company . If the annuity company is willing to invest in lower rated bonds , the return will be high because of the increased risk . Annuity companies also have the flexibility to invest in bonds with different maturity schedules . This can have an impact on your annuity renewal rate based on when you purchased your annuity and the timing as the bond market moves up and down over time . Annuity rates have recently dropped and while nobody has a crystal ball to know exactly where rates are going , here 's an approach you can think about and see if it addresses your concern . You can use what is called a `` ladder '' approach . Take the total amount of what you intend to put into an annuity and split it into 3 or 4 pieces . Purchase one annuity now with 1/3 or 1/4 of your total amount
4 Medicare Part B is typically deducted from your social security check . Your Medicare Supplement premium is typically set up as an automatic payment between the insurance carrier and your checking account . You may still be able to mail in your payment but most carriers would prefer you to set up the automatic payment . There is an advantage for you in doing this . Medicare Supplement Plans are `` guaranteed renewable '' which means the only way the insurance carrier can cancel your plan is for non payment .
Question 8:
Which Company Has The Best Retirement Plan ?
Positive Answer:
There is no one company that has the best retirement plan for anyone individual . Company sponsored ERISA plans are qualified vehicles that hold investment products . Those products should be based on your risk tolerance and retirement planning goals . Some retirement plans are no ERISA plans and may have more flexibility , however investment suitability per investor needs to be quantified through the client interview process and an investor profile .
Negative Answers:
1 Call your Agent . If you do n't have an agent ... get one ! He/she will be much more helpful in the claims process than calling an 1-800 number . Regardless of who you call , you should tell the person you speak with what you are making a claim on and someone should be in touch with you to verify information and get the process started .
2 You can cancel your individual health insurance policy at any time . Typically , contacting your broker or insurer by email or phone will start the easy process . It is possible that at some point , your request will have to be made in writing . The unused portion of your premium will be promptly refunded . Typically it takes about 10-14 days . If you are trying to cancel group health insurance coverage through an employer , it may be a bit more involved . You should contact your HR representative and discuss the best way to terminate your plan . As an experienced health insurance broker with more than 32 years of experience , I have handled many healthcare policy terminations . I encourage our clients to always call or email us for any issue , whether it be terminating coverage or purchasing a new Exchange policy through our website .
3 I suppose you could have two health insurance policies in effect at the same time . But why would you ? You ca n't duplicate coverage and get paid twice , so it would not make financial sense . It 's easier to shop and compare the most affordable plans and purchase the policy that best fits your needs . As experienced and unbiased brokers , that 's our job !
4 what is a life insurance dividend ? Dividends are paid out to whole life policy holders of mutual companies . Mutual companies are policyholder owned , there are no stockholders . Dividends by IRS explaination are a return of unused premium and not subject to income tax . A dividend is made up of three things , investement returns . savings from operating expenses and savings from unused funds set aside for death claims .
Question 9:
Does Credit History Affect Auto Insurance ?
Positive Answer:
Yes it can . Credit is a factor with many companies . Insurance companies give an insurance score . It is different than a credit score . A variety of factors including credit are considered . Some companies still don ; t do credit , but usually you will pay a higher rate . The insurance company reasoning is that , by their statistics and experience , a person with bad credit statistically is a higher risk . I know that is not always the case but unfortunately , agree or not -LRB- and I do n't like it either -RRB- that is the facts .
Negative Answers:
1 That is a great question ! The amount that your policy pays to the beneficiary is called the face amount , or death benefit . It is the stated sum on the policy , -LRB- the large number -RRB- and there will also be a smaller number called the surrender value . If the insured passes away , the company pays the face value -LRB- minus any loans , or unpaid premiums -RRB- to the beneficiary . If you decide to cash the policy out early , the surrender value -LRB- minus loans , fees , and unpaid premiums -RRB- are paid to the policy owner . Thanks for asking !
2 Auto insurance is an at will product . This means that you can change carriers at any point that you wish . You will have to pay your premium to the carrier you are signing with and then inform your current carrier to cancel your policy effective the start date of the new policy . Your current carrier should refund any unused portion of the premium that you already paid for the current term .
3 The net cash value of a life insurance policy is the amount of cash that you would receive if you were to surrender the policy . It is the current cash value accumulation , minus any fees or surrender charges . The net cash value will also subtract from the cash value , any loans you had taken out against your policy .
4 It can , yes . Naturally talk to your Insurance Professional about the specific terms and conditions of your policy , but in most cases , you will find that there is coverage , subject to your policy deductible . In order to open a theft claim , in most cases , you will need to file a loss report with your local police and obtain a copy of that report for the claims professional . The claims person will also need to have a very good description of the bike , including color and serial number if you have it . Photos are a very good thing to have as well .
Question 10:
What If Life Insurance Beneficiary Dies ?
Positive Answer:
If the beneficiary dies , the owner of the policy can change the beneficiary . Many policies contain provisions about the beneficiary dying simultaneously with the insured , these need special consideration . If the beneficiary dies and the policy isnt altered , the contingent beneficiary will receive the proceeds . If there isnt a contingent beneficiary the proceeds will be probated .
Negative Answers:
1 Medicare Plan F supplemental insurance -LRB- also known as Medigap plan F -RRB- is a supplement to fill in the claim gaps not paid by Medicare . Medicare has deductibles , copay 's and coinsurance that can amount to considerable out of pocket expenses . Medicare plan F pays 100 % of approved Medicare Part A and Part B expenses .
2 Yes , you can transfer ownership of life insurance policies . There are , however , some things of which you should be aware . If the policy is currently assigned for collateral , or there is an irrevocable beneficiary , their consent would be required before a transfer . In Canada , with one exception , transfers of ownership are considered a deemed disposition . In other words , it is the same as if you cashed the policy in and it may trigger a taxable event . The one exception is a transfer to your child when the child is the only life insured under the policy . This creates an opportunity for an intergenerational wealth transfer . -LRB- If interested ask me for details -RRB- . Child includes any natural or adopted child , grandchild , stepchild , son or daughter - in-law . Check to be sure of the consequences , before you make a transfer . If you have further questions , or feel that I could be of assistance , please do not hesitate to contact me . If you would like to work with a local life insurance broker , you could start
3 Life insurance proceeds are not charged income tax in Ohio , or in any other state . If the death benefit if taken in installments , the interest on the life insurance payments is taxed . And if the estate is over $ 5,250,000 the excess above that amount will be charged federal estate taxes .
4 That is a great question ! It is n't a Federal law , but it is in most States , Counties , and Cities . The damage and expense of uninsured motorists is something no one wants , so it is pretty much everywhere that you will find a law about having insurance if you want to drive . The penalties for driving uninsured are very high , and it is so much more worth it to spend the money on the policy . Please do not consider hitting the road without it . Thanks for asking !
Question 11:
Which Type Of Life Insurance Is Best ?
Positive Answer:
Which Type Of Life Insurance Is Best ? Whether youre looking for term or permanent life insurance coverage for single or survivorship life , even cash value policies for tax advantaged incomeyou need to shop to secure the best policy that addresses your specific needs . And to that point : Your age , gender , smoking status and health condition dictates the price youll pay for life insurance coverage . Each company accesses the potential insured differently . Sometimes benevolent underwriting companies treat health conditions more favorably than others . Another consideration is the financial reason for purchasing life insurance : indemnification , income or inheritance planning strategies . There is just no one life insurance company that is the best in all three planning categories or health conditions . We carry the full inventory of the spreadsheet brokerage market that occupies the top rankings in each category . And we can show you that .
Negative Answers:
1 A whole life policy accumulates cash value . This cash value increases over time . While you can cash surrender the policy at any time , you will only receive the amount of cash surrender value in the policy , you do not receive the face amount . The longer you hold on to the policy the more cash accumulation you have . Remember that when you surrender a policy by cashing it in you will lose the death benefit . If you need the insurance then take a loan on the policy if you need cash . Just make sure you pay the interest each year . The amount of the oan will be deducted from the death benefit if something happens to you .
2 The official name for `` ObamaCare '' is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -LRB- PPACA -RRB- . It is also commonly referred to as Obama care , health care reform and the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ACA -RRB- . The Affordable Care Act -LRB- ACA -RRB- was signed into law to reform the health care industry by President Barack Obama on March 23 , 2010 and upheld by the supreme court on On June 28 , 2012 . The goal of healthcare reform is to give more Americans access to affordable , quality health insurance and to reduce the growth in health care spending in the U.S. . The fact is healthcare reform and the newly opened exchanges do not replace private insurance , Medicare , or Medicaid . If you have health coverage you like , you can keep it . Many of the ACA 's numerous provisions have already been enacted . The rest of the program starts in 2013-2014 and continues to roll out until 2022 . Healthcare reform offers a number of new benefits , rights and protections including the requirement that all new health insurance plans cover preventive services and provide new essential
3 The term `` select '' when dealing with any type of life insurance is meaningless . There are internet sites that have that word in their name , perhaps because they have already determined which companies to offer coverage from . This is just advertising but with no real value for the consumer , on the internet or off .

If you need it and dont have it , then you have a problem that you are probably not ready to face .
Question 12:
What Does Life Insurance Cash Value Mean ?
Positive Answer:
Whole life insurance policies also known as permanent insurance along with some other types of products such as universal life insurance build up a cash value after the insurance has been in force over an extended period of time . The cost per $ 1,000 of coverage is more expensive than term insurance and part of the premium is credited to the insureds cash value account . Keith Prim Dallas , TX 214-435-0791
Negative Answers:
1 Any life insurance company can provide the insurance you would like to get on your mother providing she qualifies per what was already mentioned . What you need to know is your mother will have to sign the application . Depending on the type of policy , she may have to answer medical questions as well as give some blood and urine . Contact your agent to discuss the needs and the process that will have to be folowed .
2 Life insurance expires on the maturity date of the policy or earlier in the case of cash value policies that lapse due to insufficient policy values . Term policies self terminate relatively early and without value . The maturity date of permanent policies issued in recent years is usually extended by policy provision or rider past age 100 to ensure the policy only matures due to death of the insured .
3 Skin tags are benign growths on the skin that can form anywhere but are most common on the eyelid , face , neck , armpit or groin . Removal is a relatively simple and painless outpatient procedure . In most cases skin tags do not pose a medical problem and removal is for cosmetic reasons . In some situations the tag may be in a place on the body where clothing rubs against it and it becomes quite unpleasant . In those situations it is possible your carrier will pay for removal of the skin tag .
4 No . Life Insurance Carriers will not cancel your policy after developing Cancer or other serious medical conditions . They may cancel for non-payment of premiums or failure to disclose , if it was a preexisting condition . However , if you have a Term Life policy that expires after 10-30 years , it may not be possible to qualify for new coverage .
Question 13:
How Is Car Insurance Paid ?
Positive Answer:
This is up to your insurance carrier . Many insurance carriers allow you to pay for your auto insurance coverage weekly , monthly , quarterly , semi-annually , or annually . Your auto insurance policy will typically be established for a six month or twelve month period of time . There are a few carriers that have shorter periods of time available but are typically more costly . To pay for your coverage many carriers accept cash , check , money order , eft , debit card , or credit card .
Negative Answers:
1 Great question ! Your insurance company should reach out to you within a day or two if a claim has been filed regarding your policy . They would need statements from you and pictures of any damage done to your vehicle , so it would be strange if they did not contact you .
2 A 401 -LRB- k -RRB- is funded with before tax contributions . Income tax has not been paid on either the amount contributed to the plan , the employers contribution if any , or the gain the plan has realized . That income tax would need to be paid if the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- were rolled into a Roth IRA . The preferred method for any roll-over is a direct , trustee to trustee exchange . If you accept your 401 -LRB- k -RRB- in cash you must roll-over the amount quickly and carefully . See a licensed insurance agent to accomplish this roll-over .
3 You pay for long term insurance by sending the insurance company a check every month , three months , six months or annually . The payment can be paid electronically through a checking account and there may be insurers that bill you directly . Each carrier is different so you can ask your full-time broker to explain the billing methods of the companies . Regarding how long you pay , it depends how long you want coverage . Until you are collecting on a claim , you would have to pay premiums .
4 The cost of prenatal and delivery will vary greatly by area , level of care needed , etc. . I have several clients in Georgia that have successfully negotiated with the doctor and hospital and set up a prepayment arrangement . A normal vaginal delivery without complications , including prenatal care , can run around $ 8000 to $ 9000 dollars . Add another $ 2000 for scheduled c-section .
Question 14:
What Is The Most You Can Put In A Roth IRA ?
Positive Answer:
The most that you can contribute to a Roth IRA is $ 5,500 per year or $ 6,500 per year if you are age 50 and older . If you have funds that are qualified for a roll-over to a Roth IRA there isnt a limit to that transaction . The Roth option is increasingly popular as people are apprehensive about lower tax rates in the future .
Negative Answers:
1 We have wonderful jargon in our profession ! Attained age is used in the context of a life insurance policy that has already been issued and simply refers to the age the insured is now as opposed to the age of the insured when the policy was issued . Life insurance rates are , among other things , age-based . Thus , terms were developed over time to describe age in a life insurance contract in a variety of contexts .
2 Only the owner of the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- can withdraw money . If the owner is deceased , then the beneficary can make a claim to receive the balance of the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- . You need to be aware that when a withdrawal of monies is made , taxes will be owed the year the withdrawal is made .
3 The best type of life insurance to buy depends on your needs and income . You can start by using a life insurance calculator found on some websites , to determine what role life insurance could play in your family 's financial portfolio . Most people use Term insurance to cover events over a limited period of time , such as getting your children through college or paying off a mortgage if the breadwinner was to die an untimely death . For events that have no time limit , such as using life insurance to pay for funereal expenses or to pass an inheritance to your descendants , permanent Life Insurance may be best . A good agent can help you translate your needs and budget into affordable life insurance coverage that will be best for you and those you are trying to protect .

Does Medicare Pay For An EKG ?
Positive Answer:
Yes ! Medicare will cover an EKG in one of two scenarios : 1 -RRB- When you 're new to Medicare , Medicare will cover an EKG screening with a referral from your doctor as a result of your one-time `` welcome to Medicare '' preventive visit . 2 -RRB- The other scenario is when your doctor orders it for diagnostic purposes . An EKG is covered under Medicare Part B. Medicare will pay for about 80 % of the costs after the Part B deductible is met -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- - you would be responsible for the other 20 % and the Part B deductible . When you first enroll in Medicare Part B , you open your 6-month initial open enrollment period to buy a Medicare supplement plan -LRB- a.k.a. Medigap plan -RRB- with NO MEDICAL UNDERWRITING ! . A Medigap plan can cover the deductibles and a portion or all of the other 20 % of expenses covered by Part B and features a number of other big advantages as well . An experienced broker can help find the plan that 's most suitable for you and your budget . Please let me know

1 Responsibility for injury or damage resulting from the ownership of a car and the risk of damage to the car itself begins when you take title . In Massachusetts , you are required to have the required liability insurance before the car can be operated on the roads of the Commonwealth .
2 Health insurance rates are determined by age , gender , zip code , plan design , your overall health and other factors . Older people usually pay more than younger ones . Healthier people pay less than those who have medical conditions . Plan design also weighs heavily on the rate . Plans with low deductibles -LRB- less than $ 2000 -RRB- and copay 's are more expensive than a high deductible plan that lacks copay 's . A family of 6 will pay more than a family of 2 .
3 Traditional Key Man Disability Insurance is a form of Short Term Disability Insurance that is used to cover key -LRB- hard to replace , executives , top salespeople , etc -RRB- employees in a business . The business is the beneficiary . The income paid to the business when the key person is disabled helps the business to operate until the employee is back on their feet , or gives them the funds to find a replacement .
4 Generally Bank owned life insurance is designed to protect the bank if you take out a loan . I usually recommend buying your own policy . It gives your beneficiary more options . For example , mortgage insurance is usually offered by a bank . It can also be purchased on your own . Both would pay off the mortgage if you die . With the bank owned policy , that is the only choice . What if your spouse does n't want or need to pay off the mortgage however . This is not always the best option . If you own the policy , your wife or beneficiary may choose to invest the life insurance funds and use the interest to help make mortgage payments . Or the money would be more advantageous elsewhere . Mortgage life insurance with the bank is tied to that mortgage . What if you move ? Owning your own policy is portable , you can take it with you to your new home . I usually recommend level term to cover a mortgage . That way you have extra protection as your mortgage decreases because the death benefit will stay level .

4 The cost of life insurance is extremely variable based on one 's age , health , and the type of policy one purchases . The premium for a $ 100,000 policy can range from a few dollars per month to hundreds of dollars per month , depending on these variables . A good place to start is to look at how much you need , and also how much you can afford to spend on life insurance . You do n't want to get in over your head and have to drop the policy in a short time . But if your family or business would suffer without you , it is an important purchase worth budgeting for , too .

Negative Answers:
1 As Nancy Pelosi informed us , we wo n't exactly know until it all takes effect . The Affordable Care Act is still rolling out and the major changes start in January 2014 . Some things we do know , the insurance companies wo n't be able to decline or charge extra to people with poor health . That will definitely affect premiums for everyone . It will make premiums less affordable for people who were already paying for their own health insurance and DID health qualify . It will require a lot of people to buy health insurance that did n't buy it before . That part will be good for the insurance companies . It has required that they operate on a 20 % margin . This has caused them to tighten up and lay off thousands of salaried and hourly employees . Most likely in my opinion this is an experiment that is doomed to fail . Once it fails , the whole health insurance system will go to a single payer government run system exactly like Medicare . That will be an improvement over this . But it will be very , very expensive on our
2 If you know what company the policy is from , just look them up and call . You will be asked to provide a policy number , identify yourself and what you need to know .

3 Yes generally they do take health insurance depending on the procedure , however you will need to check with your local planned parenthood and give them the insurance you have as well as your member number to assure correct billing .

Negative Answers:
1 Term life insurance is very popular to cover indemnification planning scenarios . Its cheap and does the job . Permanent life insurance for those in high tax brackets is very popular as supplemental retirement income and executive compensation plans . Permanent life insurance also works well for estate planning , charitable giving and making a difference in succeeding family generations .
2 Can a child get life insurance for an adult ? It will depend on the age of the child as an insurance contract requirestheowner of the policy be of legal age . If younger than 18 or without court recognitionmaking the minor able to contract as an adult , it wouldnot be allowed . Of legal age and with the consent of the parent who will be the insured , not a problem .
3 Accident and Critical illness insurance are similar in structure , but cover different things . Both policies will typically pay out a lump sum or up the benefit amount directly to the insured or a provider of their choice . The difference however is that accident plans only cover medical expenses associated with an accident where as critical illness insurance pays lump sum upon diagnosis of a major critical illness . Make sure to read the list of covered critical illness ' in the policy before purchasing .
4 The cost of having a baby without health insurance could be as low as five thousand dollars if a mid wife and birthing center are used , and millions of dollars if your baby needs specialized care in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit . The Affordable Care Act provides benefits for maternity and newborn care , plus hospitalization . Women can purchase a policy while pregnant that covers her preexisting pregnancy with no waiting period , provided she enrolls during the open enrollment period . The open enrollment period for 2014 ends on March 31 . The premiums paid for a policy would be much smaller than funding the costs of having a baby yourself .
Question 19:
What Is No Medical Exam Life Insurance ?
Positive Answer:
That is a great question ! Simply put , a no-med exam policy is just that - there are no para-meds or doctor 's exams required to get the policy . Instead , there is usually a phone interview with an underwriter , or a series of health questions , or possibly no questions at all . In the case of the interview or questionnaires , the company will also check your pharmacy records , and with the MIB for your insurance claim history . These policies are usually for lower amounts of death benefits , and may have conditions attached about when , and how much , they pay out . Please ask a trusted agent to help you , okay ? Thanks for asking !
Negative Answers:
1 Routine vitamin D testing is not covered by Medicare . However , if you have a condition or treatment that might cause your vitamin D level to be either too high or too low , they will pay for it to be monitored properly . Talk to your doctor to see if any of your conditions may affect your vitamin D level .
2 You can cancel term life insurance at any time . Suppose you bought a 10-year level term policy from Transamerica four years ago . You decided that you no longer wanted the policy and decided to cancel the contract . Simply call or contact your broker or the insurer directly , and your request will be taken care of .
3 Insurance serves the primary purpose of protecting us against risk . When we take out a policy it is to help us with the loss of a loved one . Children need a policy because they create a loss in the event of their untimely death . In addition if a child gets a good policy at an early age while they are still healthy they can get the best policy for the best price .
4 There is no such thing as best and cheapest , you will get what you pay for . You should always purchase as much Liability BI or bodily Injury and property damage insurance as you can in the event you cause the accident and injure the other party , their medical expenses will be covered up to the threshold you chose on your policy . If you have assets , consider purchasing a liability umbrella as well for added liability protection . The way to having the least expensive premium is having as many discounts as possible such as multi policy / married / location matters / good driving history matters / continuous liability matters / defensive driver course helps / the type of car matters / if the vehicle is newer , you will want collision and comprehensive to name a few !
Question 20:
How Much Long Term Care Insurance Can I Afford ?
Positive Answer:
Long term care -LRB- LTC -RRB- insurance is a part of defensive planning for your retirement . Long term care policies price their premiums on the basis of your gender , age , smoking status , health history and current medical condition . You have three considerations for long term care coverage : a stand alone policy , an annuity or life insurance with an LTC rider .
Negative Answers:
1 The term `` valid '' might have a couple different meanings . The first might be whether or not your auto insurance policy is in force . Normally , if you have paid your premiums and you have not made any changes to your policy that would make you ineligible - your policy should be `` in-force '' . As previously stated , you need to check your insurance ID cards or policy delarations page to confirm the effective and expiration dates for your policy . The other situation where you might find the term `` valid '' is if you lease a vehicle . In this case , the bank or leaseholder , which is the actual owner of the vehicle might require you , the lessee , to carry minimum liability coverage on your insurance policy . A normal amount of liability coverage that you may be required to carry would be 100,000 / 300,000 / 100,000 with deductibles for comprehensive and collision no higher than $ 1,000 . If your policy affords coverage to meet these requirements , the leasing company would deem your coverage to be `` valid '' . Hope this helps . -- @MooneyInsurance
2 Life insurance net cash value is the amount of cash value less the amount of any loans that the insured has taken against the cash accumulation in the policy . Since this event is not taxable , many owners of whole life insurance borrow the values from the policy versus getting a commercial loan . Keith Prim Dallas , TX 214-435-0791
3 When a life insurance policy lapses , it means that the policy would no longer pay the death benefit if death of the insured person would occur . Policies lapse due to non-payment ; whether by accident or on purpose . When the policy lapses , there is usually a chance to reinstate it by filling out some paperwork and making up for the missed premium . However , reinstatement requires that the insured person 's health has not changed from the health rating it was when the policy was originally purchased . If unable to qualify for reinstatement a new policy will be needed .
4 Life insurance typically does not impact your credit score . However , car payments and mortgage payments can have a huge impact on your score if you constantly are late with your payments . A lower credit score means it will cost you more to borrow money , and over time , that could cost thousands of extra dollars . Also , if you have TOO MUCH life insurance and are paying quite a bit , it could impact your score . This question was also answered by Tyler Maddox earlier in the year .
